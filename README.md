# adaptive-markdown
Convert markdown into [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/)

The goal of this project is to ease the authoring experience for Adaptive Cards.  It is much easier and more expressive for most folks (in my opinion) to write in markdown than it is in JSON.

So a better authoring experience can still take advantage of the rendering surface of Adaptive Cards as well as retain the original markdown
